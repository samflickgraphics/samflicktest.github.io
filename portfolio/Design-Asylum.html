title: Design Asylum
description: Design Asylum is a student run organization for student designers at Western Kentucky University as part of the Art depratment. They help provide services and oppurtunities through volunteer work for small local businesses and non-profits that live around Bowling Green, Kentucky. I created the logo design and branding for this organization. <br> I designed their stationery, website, as well as a style guide for the organization. <br> I took the concept of an asylum being a shelter so I designed the A in a way that sheltered the D. Based on those sketches from yesterday and their current branding, I came up with this concept with the low-poly background transitioning from a salmon to a dark blue with the logo positioned on top.
