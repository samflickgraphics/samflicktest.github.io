title: City Within the Trees
description:  The point of this series was to play around with the lighting and the colors to create this dark, intense mood. I also wanted to mix a city within a forest scene for the visual aspects and such. For the pieces, I started off with a picture of a street intersection and removed the people inside of the photo. Next, I added in a new sky and cut out the forest image and composited the two photos together with color adjustments. Then, I added in a light source in the bottom right corner to add in a contrasting color to the piece. Finally, I added in lighting effects and other adjustments to create the final composite. The process is similar throughout the series through its creation from pre-production to post-production with similar lighting techniques and similar techniques used to for example cut out the trees from its background. This series is an ongoing series until I feel that I have made a sufficient number of pieces that I see fit.
