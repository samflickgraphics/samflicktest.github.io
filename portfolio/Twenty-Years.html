title: Twenty Years Magazine
description: This massive multi-media project was created as part of a collaborative effort between Western Kentucky University and the College Heights Herald. The project involves a 48-page magazine and a website that explains the history behind WKU President Gary Ransdell's presidency and the impacts that he made on shaping the university into what it has become today. <br> I was on a design team of three other designers who were also part of a larger publication. I was in charge of the front half of the magazine specifically pages 7 to page 12. <br> The website concept was made by me but the actual design was made by Craig Ostertag and Nicole Ares. It uses Wordpress CMS and has three pages in total. <br> The magazine was released on April 27th, 2017 with Volume 92 Issue 51 of the College Heights Herald Newspaper.
