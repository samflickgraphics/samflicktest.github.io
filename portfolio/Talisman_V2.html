title: Talisman Magazine Vol. 2
description: Last May, I was part of the staff for the creation of the Second volume of the Talisman magazine. Much like last edition, I was a page layout designer for the magazine. The staff which was divided into multiple sections and consisted of 35+ employees was tasked to make the content provided inside of this magazine and lay it out on the page. I created a smaller amount of spreads compared to last edition because of the larger design staff and because of my then-new job at the College Heights Herald.
