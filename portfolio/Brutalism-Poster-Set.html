title: Brutalism Poster Set - "One of Many"
description: Over the summer, I had decided to enter into some galleries in Louisville. In July, I entered into the Kaviar Art Gallery in the exhibition titled “Image and Word”, a 2D and 3D typography art exihibtion that went from August 28th to Ocotber 7th, 2017.  The print that I chose to display was 18x24in and went for a starting price of $90. With this being my first professional gallery exihibtion, it was a pleasant experience that I hope to encounter again in the future.
