title: Sun and Storm
description: For this piece, I wanted to try and create something warm and dramatic out of an otherwise cool and calm photograph.  To complete this task, I applied Hue/Saturation colorize layers with colors sampled from the sky on low opacity onto everything else in the scene. I also added in lightning and rain layers set to the blend mode of color dodge to give the lightning the same color as the sky so that half of the composite was sun and the other half was storm. <br><br> I used photos from unsplash.com and from previous projects to complete this piece. The subject came attached to the original photo of the mountain. I used Photoshop CC 2017 for the composition and Adobe Bridge CC 2017 for file management. <br> This piece was featured on <a href="https://madewith.unsplash.com/categories/remix">madewithunsplash.unsplash.com</a> under the category of remix.
