title: Talisman Magazine
description:  In Fall of 2016, I had a job working as a layout designer for the WKU talisman magazine. It was the first of its kind, being rebranded as a magazine after being a yearbook for over 50 years. <br><br> The magazine is replacing the yearbook and so they are released two times a year. The first magazine is based around Identity, showcasing all forms of identity, from religion to tattoos and to race and culture which all relates to Identity. I was a layout designer who designed four of the stories and the horoscopes and got to produce marketing materials for the magazine.
