title: Hachiko Square - VHS
description: This piece is a photo manipulation of which this photo of Hachiko Square in Tokyo, Japan has been transformed in a VHS surveillance monitor screen. <br> To create this piece, I used RGB curves adjustments upon individual layers and then I moved them to different locations to create the RGB duplication. I then appllied a hologram texture a couple of times with pattern overlay and increased sautration on the image. I then added the REC in the upper left corner of the piece.
