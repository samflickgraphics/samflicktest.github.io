title: Polygon
description: This poster was inspired by line art projects that I have been doing in my 2D design class at Western Kentucky University. <br> First, I created the polygon in Illustrator using pen tool. Next, I opened the polygon in Photoshop and modified the colors. I then added the background scene using photos from textures.com and Flickr. Next, I added a spotlight onto a composite and set the blend mode to hard light. Finally, I added a gradient map to solidify the green and blue colors. <br>This poster design is featured in the 2016 Juror-Selected Invitational Student Exhibit at Western Kentucky University. This poster is also featured in the Kentucky Council on Post-Secondary Education in Frankfort, Kentucky.
