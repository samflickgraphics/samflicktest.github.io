title: Concrete Swim
description: Over the weekend, I decided to actually go outside and take some photos around my dorm at WKU. It was a bright, sunny day with a lot of hard light so it was relatively difficult to find some areas with even distribution of light. However, I stumbled on a concrete storm drain which served as the basis of this composite. I began working on this idea that I had with someone jumping out of the cement as if it was in a liquid state. I found this image off of Pexels of a woman in a swimming competition to use in this particular composite image. For the final composite, I used 4 photos in total with two of them being concrete textures, one of a previous shot image of a cloud sky, and the aforementioned Pexels photo.
