title: Kafe Coffee Shop UI Concept
description: I have completed this app concept for a coffee shop. This was created in Adobe XD over the course of a week and there was about 16 screens total going from main pages to menus to login and account information. <br> I used fonts Courier New and Hind with desaturated brown and green for the main colors to portray the rustic, coffee shop vibe associated with typical cafes. I also focused on making this design as streamlined as possible in order to make it easier for someone to navigate the app.
