<p>Tomorrow is my last day of summer vacation. It has been a stressful, quiet, but eventful summer with lots of highs and lows throughout. It has been eventful at times, it has been quiet at times, and it has been stressful most of the time.</p>

<p>After finishing freshman year, I had all sorts of things that I wanted to do. Whether it was out of an urge for self-improvement, an urge for self-discovery, or rather the feeling of wanting something to do to prevent you from the death of endless silence. Of the things that I wanted to do this summer was to keep churning out new project ideas, join a community concert band in Louisville, and get out of the house a lot more often.</p>

<p>In going through the summer months, I had completed most of these goals. I had created my projects, “Nebulae”, “One of Many”, and “City Within the Trees” just to name a few. I even got into my first professional art gallery exhibition at the Kaviar Art Gallery in Louisville. I had redesigned my website to better equip myself to get an internship for the fall semester. I got to travel to Chicago for a trip relating to my sister and her modelling career which was another experience. Finally, I joined the River Cities Community Concert Band in Louisville playing alternating between 2nd and Bass Trombone.</p>

<p>At the end of the summer, I ended up realizing that I had overscheduled myself with my work at the College Heights Herald (@WKUHerald), WKU Talisman Magazine (@WKUTalisman) and Imagewest Ad Agency (@WKUImagewest) has conflicted with my time in the marching band. I ended up cutting marching band from my schedule and had settled here with one day left.</p>
