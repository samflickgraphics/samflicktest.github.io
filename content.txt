-lack of uniform design
-bad logo
-no pictures of campus on landing page, hard to figure out what campus looks like
-outdated aesthetic
-landing page is news, which the audience doesn't care about unless they are already involved with UCLA in some way
-responsiveness is not optimal
-menus are small and hard to navigate. It's hard to know where to go if you're a prospective student vs. current, etc.
-photos are not very good
-site is difficult to get around. Feels like there are multiple pages for the same thing but with different information
