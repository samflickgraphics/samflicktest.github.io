The UCLA brand is very corporate oriented and not user-friendly. The whole aesthetic is very off putting and disorients me when I land on their website. There are so many pages that are on the website that I get stuck when I land on the site and with so many options to choose from that I get paralysis when I see it.

I think that the website needs to have a refined non-italicized logo, updated colors and imagery, and a simpler website design that points me in the direction where I need to go.
