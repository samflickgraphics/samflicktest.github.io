I am a graphic designer, web designer, and digital artist who is just outside Louisville, Kentucky, USA. Currently, I am attending Western Kentucky University and am majoring in Advertising and minoring in Graphic Design.

Right now, I am working at the College Heights Herald and WKU Talisman Magazine at Western Kentucky University as a graphic designer and web designer. I designed spreads for the first edition of the Talisman. In addition to this, I have also recently joined the design team at the College Heights Herald where I am creating newspaper and webpage layouts for them as they deliver stories to the campus. I have also recently gotten an internship at Imagewest ad agency in Bowling Green, Kentucky where that begins this fall.

I have been in a number of exhibitions on both a local and regional scale. In high school, I won a Silver Key at the 2016 Scholastic Art and Writing Awards in Louisville, Kentucky. In university, I got the opportunity to exhibit my work at a Juror Selected Art Exhibition hosted by Western Kentucky University to which my work was displayed at the Kentucky Council on Post-Secondary Education in Frankfort, Kentucky. In August, I got to be in my first professional exhibition at the Kaviar Art Gallery under the exhibition, “Image and Word.”
